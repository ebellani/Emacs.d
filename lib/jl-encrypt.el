;; Changelog:
;; 2012/03/09, Version 1.1, initial release
;; 2013/03/18, Version 2.1, integrate patch by konubinix to also encrypt
;;   e-mail that already contains a secure sign tag:
;;   - Add functions jl-is-signed-p and jl-do-not-sign-p.
;;   - Change jl-secure-message-gpg and jl-secure-message-smime to use
;;     jl-do-not-sign-p (and not only jl-encrypt-without-signature).
;;   - Change jl-message-send-maybe-exit to look for secure encrypt tag
;;     (instead of any secure tag).
;;   - Add Changelog, give credit to konubinix
;; 2013/07/01, Version 3.1, support XEmacs, don't break news, don't replace
;;   S/MIME tag with GnuPG tag if possible.  New version started based on
;;   feedback and testing by Michael Strauss.
;;   - Replace delete-dups with mm-delete-duplicates as XEmacs does not have
;;     delete-dups.
;;   - Bug fixed when rebinding keys: Use (interactive "P") instead of
;;     (interactive "p").
;;   - Do not attempt to encrypt news postings, only go for e-mails with
;;     non-empty recipient lists.
;;   - If the user inserted an S/MIME signature tag, and S/MIME as well as
;;     GnuPG keys are available, don't prefer GnuPG any more but upgrade
;;     S/MIME signature to S/MIME sign+encrypt.
;;   - Refactoring.
;;     - Added jl-method-table, jl-access-method-table, jl-mail-recipients,
;;       jl-maybe-add-tag, jl-maybe-add-tag-for-args, jl-is-smime-p.
;;     - Based on above, simplified jl-proceed-without-encryption-p and
;;       jl-encrypt-if-possible.
;;     - Moved jl-certfile-available-p and jl-secure-message-smime to
;;       jl-smime.
;;   - Explain potential unsafety of Bcc headers.  Safety check added.
;;     Added jl-encrypt-safe-bcc-list.
;;   - Changed jl-gpgkey-available-p to produce less false positives.
;;   - Replaced jl-encrypt-without-signature with jl-encrypt-insert-signature.
;;     Have jl-encrypt-if-possible use it.  Bug fix in jl-is-signed-p.
;;   - Different treatment of From header.  See comment for new variable
;;     jl-encrypt-ignore-from.
;;   - Simplified internal recipient lists now contain just lower-case e-mail
;;     addresses (no names any longer).
;;   - Use defcustom instead of defvar for user variables, which are also
;;     renamed.
;; 2013/12/20, Version 4-beta, unified use of EasyPG for gpg and gpgsm.
;;   - Removed variables jl-encrypt-ignore-from and
;;     jl-encrypt-recipient-headers.
;;     Treatment of encryption targets now controlled entirely by EasyPG
;;     (and GnuPG configuration files).  New functions jl-epg-find-usable-keys
;;     and jl-epg-check-unique-keys towards that end.
;;   - New variable jl-encrypt-manual-choice.
;;     If several public keys are available for a recipient, ask user which
;;     one to use.  (Requires `mm-encrypt-option' introduced in Emacs 23.2.)
;; 2013/12/31, Version 4.1.
;;   - Take care of interface change for mml2015-epg-find-usable-key
;;     starting with Ma Gnus v0.7.
;;   - Updated documentation.
;; 2014/09/16, Version 4.2.
;;   - No change in functionality.
;;   - Use message-send-hook instead of key rebinding.
;;   - Replaced jl-encrypt-manual-choice with
;;     jl-encrypt-i-am-aware-of-mm-encrypt-option.
;;   - Renamed jl-mail-recipients to jl-message-recipients and
;;     jl-encrypt-address-list to jl-message-address-list.
;; 2016/03/28, Version 4.3.
;;   - No change in functionality.
;;   - Adapted for Emacs 25.1.

;;; Commentary:
;; Gnus supports GnuPG via the insertion of so-called MML secure tags, which
;; contain encryption instructions to be performed before a message is sent.
;; However, by default those tags need to be added manually, which can easily
;; be forgotten.  In contrast, DefaultEncrypt aims to insert those tags
;; automatically if public keys for all recipients are available.
;;
;; I assume that you are familiar with GnuPG support for Gnus messages as
;; described in Info node `(message) Security':
;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/message/Security.html
;; Moreover, DefaultEncrypt is based on EasyPG, the default interface of
;; Emacs for OpenPGP and S/MIME, see Info node `(epa)':
;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/epa/index.html
;;
;; DefaultEncrypt aims for automatic insertion of an MML secure encryption
;; tags into messages if public keys (either GnuPG public keys or S/MIME
;; certificates) for all recipients are available.  In addition, before a
;; message is sent, the user is asked whether plaintext should really be sent
;; unencryptedly when public keys for all recipients are available.
;;
;; The above works by adding
;; `mml-secure-encrypt-if-possible' to `gnus-message-setup-hook' and
;; `mml-secure-check-encryption-p' to `message-send-hook'.
;;
;; Note that with EasyPG, e-mail is *not* encrypted to (a key for) the
;; From address (see Info node `(epa) Mail-mode integration').
;; Instead, to make sure that you can decrypt your own e-mails, typical
;; options are
;; * to customize mml-secure-openpgp-encrypt-to-self or
;; * to use a Bcc header to encrypt the e-mail to one of your own
;;   GnuPG identities (see `mml-secure-safe-bcc-list' then) or
;; * to use the encrypt-to or hidden-encrypt-to option in gpg.conf or
;; * to use the encrypt-to option in gpgsm.conf.
;; Note that encrypt-to gives away your identity for *every*
;; encryption without warning, which is not what you want if you are
;; using, e.g., remailers.
;; Also, be careful with Bcc headers; it *might* be possible to make
;; this work without giving away the Bcc'ed identities, but it did
;; not work by default in my case, and I recommend against such a
;; thing: Only add Bcc if you are absolutely sure that you know what
;; you are doing.  See also `mml-secure-bcc-is-safe'.
;;
;; If you are interested in S/MIME then I suggest that you read this:
;; https://blogs.fsfe.org/jens.lechtenboerger/2013/12/23/openpgp-and-smime/
;; If you are still interested in S/MIME afterwards, take a look
;; at ExtendSMIME (jl-smime.el) in addition to this file.

;; Install:
;; Place this file into your load-path and add the following to ~/.emacs.
;;     (require 'jl-encrypt)
;; If you share my preferences, no further configuration should be necessary.
;;
;; Customizable variables defined in this file are
;; `mml-secure-insert-signature', `mml-secure-pgp-without-mime'.
;;
;; In addition, as explained in the following `mml-default-encrypt-method' and
;; `mml-default-sign-method' influence whether to prefer S/MIME or GnuPG in
;; certain situations, and the value of `gnus-message-replysignencrypted' may
;; be changed by this code.
;; If `mml-secure-insert-signature' is nil (the default),
;; `gnus-message-replysignencrypted' will be set to nil to avoid signatures
;; for reply messages.  You may manually add MML sign tags any time, of
;; course, but the whole point of this file is to create MML tags automatically
;; (e.g., by customizing `mml-secure-insert-signature').
;; If GnuPG and S/MIME keys are both available for the given recipients and no
;; MML tag is present, `mml-default-encrypt-method' determines what method to
;; prefer.  If `mml-secure-insert-signature' is set to `always',
;; `mml-default-sign-method' determines what method to prefer upon message
;; creation.

;; Sanity check:
;; Without any further configuration, send a GnuPG encrypted e-mail to
;; yourself as follows.  Enter your own e-mail address after To, choose some
;; Subject, and enter `M-x spook' in the body, which will insert suitable
;; text.  Then press `C-c C-c' to send the e-mail as usual (forgetting to
;; encrypt).  If you own a GnuPG public for the To e-mail address then you
;; will be asked whether you really want to send that e-mail as plaintext.
;; Answering `no' will insert an MML secure tag for you.  Press `C-c C-c'
;; again, and an encrypted e-mail will be sent.  If you receive that e-mail
;; with garbled attachments read the comment for
;; `mml-secure-pgp-without-mime'.

;; You may want to check the subsequent comments to understand the rationale
;; of my changes to standard message behavior.

;; This file is *NOT* part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Code:
(require 'gnus)
(require 'message)
(require 'mml-sec)
(require 'epg)

;; Make gnus insert MML encryption tags if keys for all recipients are
;; available.  Thus, if you reply (or wide reply) to a message or edit
;; a saved draft, then MML encryption tags will be inserted right away.
;; Moreover, if mml-secure-insert-signature is always, an MML signature
;; tag will be added immediately.

;; Note that mml-default-encrypt-method combines two separate concepts: First,
;; whether to use OpenPGP or S/MIME.  Second, if OpenPGP is chosen whether to
;; use MIME Security or not.  For me, this is not good enough.  Suppose I
;; preferred S/MIME in general (which I do not).  Then, I would need to
;; customize mml-default-encrypt-method for S/MIME.  If I then send an e-mail
;; to someone who does not use S/MIME but OpenPGP, the variable
;; mml-default-encrypt-method does not help at all, and there is no way to
;; know whether MIME Security should be used or not.  Thus, I introduce an
;; additional variable that focuses on MIME Security for OpenPGP:
(defcustom mml-secure-pgp-without-mime nil
  "Non-nil to use MML encryption without MIME Security for OpenPGP.
RFC 3156 specifies how OpenPGP (and, thus, GnuPG) and MIME work
together.  In Gnus, `mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgpmime' follows
that standard.  An alternative is
`mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgp', which represents a less
powerful approach.  If you (like me in the past) happen to send
e-mails in an environment using broken M$ SMTP servers, then your
beautiful e-mails produced by
`mml-secure-message-encrypt-pgpmime', following RFC 3156, will be
corrupted along the way.  E.g., the SMTP server at my department
throws away the e-mail's Content-Type \"multipart/encrypted\" and
its \"protocol=application/pgp-encrypted\" and inserts a
meaningless \"multipart/mixed\" one.  Thus, the recipient will
have a hard time figuring out what the e-mail's strange
attachments are good for.  FUBAR.
If this variable is set to nil (the default) then your e-mails
are built according to RFC 3156.  I suggest that you send an
encrypted e-mail to yourself.  Complain to your IT department if
you receive garbled attachments.  Then set this variable to
non-nil, while they are setting up a reasonable SMTP server.
If you are signing all your e-mails with GnuPG you probably also
want to set `mml-default-sign-method' to \"pgp\" (instead of
\"pgpmime\")."
