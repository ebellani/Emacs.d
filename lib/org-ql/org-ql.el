;;; org-ql.el --- Query language for Org buffers  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines, Org, agenda

;;; Commentary:

;; `org-ql' is a lispy query language for Org files.  It allows you to
;; find Org entries matching certain criteria and perform actions on
;; them, such as collecting their parsed representation with
;; `org-element' (the default action).

  "Find entries in BUFFERS-OR-FILES that match QUERY, and return the results of running ACTION-FN on each matching entry.

BUFFERS-OR-FILES is a form which should evaluate to one (or a
list of) file(s) or buffer(s).

QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp, unquoted.

ACTION is a sexp which will be evaluated at each matching entry
with point at the beginning of its heading.  It is passed to
`org-ql-query' as a lambda.  By default, `org-element-headline-parser'
 is called to return an Org element.

SORT is a user defined sorting function, or an unquoted list of
one or more sorting methods, including: `date', `deadline',
`scheduled', `todo', and `priority'.

If NARROW is non-nil, query will run without widening the
buffer (the default is to widen and search the entire buffer).

If MARKERS is non-nil, `org-agenda-ng--add-markers' is used to
add markers to each item, pointing to the item in its source
buffer.  In this case, ACTION should return an Org element."

;;;; Functions

(cl-defun org-ql-query (buffers-or-files query &key action narrow sort)
  "Return items matching QUERY in BUFFERS-OR-FILES.

BUFFERS-OR-FILES is a one (or a list of) file(s) or buffer(s).

QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp (quoted, since this is a
function).

ACTION is a function which is called on each matching entry, with
point at the beginning of its heading.  For example,
`org-element-headline-parser' may be used to parse an entry into
an Org element (note that it must be called with a limit
argument, so a lambda must be used to do so).  Also see
`org-ql--add-markers', which may be used to add markers
compatible with Org Agenda code.

If NARROW is non-nil, buffers are not widened.

SORT is either nil, in which case items are not sorted; or one or
a list of defined `org-ql' sorting methods: `date', `deadline',
`scheduled', `todo', and `priority'."
