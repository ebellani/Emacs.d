;;; org-ql-agenda.el --- Agenda-like view based on org-ql  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; Url: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql
;; Version: 0.1-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1") (dash "2.13") (org "9.0"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines, Org, agenda

;;; Commentary:

;; This library displays buffers similar to Org Agenda buffers, based
;; on `org-ql' queries.

;;;; Principles

;;;;; Try to imitate traditional Org agenda code's results and methods

;; The traditional agenda code is complicated, but well-optimized.  We should imitate it where
;; possible.  We should also attempt to return the same results as the traditional agenda code
;; (ultimately, that is; but whether we reach that level of complexity depends on, e.g. performance
;; achieved, whether it looks like a feasible alternative, etc).  At the least, we should return
;; results in the same format, so they can be used by other code that uses agenda output
;; (e.g. org-agenda-finalize-entries, org-agenda-finalize, org-super-agenda, etc).  Of course, this
;; goal does not necessarily apply to the "query language"-like features, and ideally the
;; agenda-like features should build upon those.

;;;;; Preserve the call to =org-agenda-finalize-entries=

;; We want to preserve the final call to org-agenda-finalize-entries to preserve compatibility
;; with other packages and functions.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'org)
(require 'org-agenda)
(require 'seq)
(require 'rx)

(require 'org-ql)

(require 'dash)
(require 's)

;;;; Variables

;;;; Macros

;; FIXME: DRY these two macros.

(cl-defmacro org-ql-agenda (&rest args)
  "Display an agenda-like buffer of entries in FILES that match QUERY.

FILES-OR-QUERY is a sexp that is evaluated to get the list of
buffers and files to scan.

QUERY is an `org-ql' query.  The query may be passed as
FILES-OR-QUERY and QUERY may be left nil, in which case the list
of files will automatically be set to the value of calling
`org-agenda-files'.

SORT is passed to `org-ql', which see..

NARROW, when non-nil, means to respect narrowing in buffers.
When nil, buffers are widened before being searched.

BUFFER, when non-nil, is a buffer or buffer name to display the
agenda in, rather than the default.

SUPER-GROUPS is used to bind variable `org-super-agenda-groups',
which see.  If t, the existing value of `org-super-agenda-groups'
is used, rather than binding it locally."
