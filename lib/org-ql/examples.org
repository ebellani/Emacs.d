** Listing bills coming due

This uses the example in the readme file, but maps across the elements returned by ~org-ql~ to present a simple list of titles and deadlines.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (--map (list (org-element-property :raw-value it)
               (org-timestamp-format (org-element-property :deadline it) "%c"))
         (org-ql (org-agenda-files)
           (and (not (done))
                (tags "bills")
                (deadline <=))
           :sort deadline))
  ;;=> (("Electric bill" "Thu 23 Aug 2018 12:00:00 AM CDT")
  ;;    ("Rent" "Sat 01 Sep 2018 08:00:00 PM CDT"))
#+END_SRC

This could also be put in a script, which could use desktop notifications to remind of bills coming due: [[examples/org-bills-due.el][org-bills-due.el]].
